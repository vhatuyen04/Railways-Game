# Railways-Game
Funny game from my course Web Programming.
Type your name, choose the dificulty and click the Start button!
You can view the rule by clicking into the Rule button.
Here are the rules:
- Left click on the cell to choose type of railway for that cell.
- Right click on the cell to rotate the cell you just built.
- There are some certain area, those you can not choose another types or can not build the railway at all.
- For the railway you built, you win if you created a continuous circular railway line that reaches every place where the train can travel.
- Build the railway before time up.
- Good luck!
